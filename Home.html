The immune system is the bodys natural defense against germs. When a germ invades, the immune system sends special cells to fight it off. Sometimes, though, the immune system is not naturally strong enough to prevent a disease from seriously harming someone or even killing them. But theres a way to give the immune system a boost. Its known as a vaccine. Vaccines are substances that prepare the immune system to fight a disease-causing germ or other pathogen by imitating an infection. They trick the immune system into making a memory of that germ without ever having to fight the real germ in the first place. Now, when the immune system encounters the real pathogen whether its a virus, bacterium or other microbe it is ready to attack it. As a result, the vaccinated person doesnt get sick. Before vaccines, many children suffered from debilitating and killer illnesses such as measles, polio, smallpox and diphtheria. A simple scratch could be deadly if it became infected with the bacteria responsible for tetanus (or lockjaw). Vaccines, though, have changed this. Smallpox is completely gone from the world, and polio nearly so. Outbreaks of measles and diphtheria are rare, especially in the United States. Tetanus infections continue to decline worldwide. Vaccinations also can help protect people who cant be vaccinated. These might be babies who are too young to receive a vaccine. Or there might be people who are too ill or too old to be vaccinated. When enough people in a community are vaccinated against a particular contagious disease, theres little opportunity for that disease to spread from person to person. Doctors call this type of community protection herd immunity. </p>

           <h1>How Vaccines Work</h1>
           <hr>
           <p> Vaccines are like a training course for the immune system. They prepare the body to fight disease without exposing it to disease symptoms. When foreign invaders such as bacteria or viruses enter the body, immune cells called lymphocytes respond by producing antibodies, which are protein molecules. These antibodies fight the invader known as an antigen and protect against further infection. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a healthy individual can produce millions of antibodies a day, fighting infection so efficiently that people never even know they were exposed to an antigen. Unfortunately, the first time the body faces a particular invader, it can take several days to ramp up this antibody response. For really nasty antigens like the measles virus or whooping cough bacteria, a few days is too long. The infection can spread and kill the person before the immune system can fight back. That's where vaccines come in. According to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Vaccine Education Center, vaccines are made of dead or weakened antigens. They can't cause an infection, but the immune system still sees them as an enemy and produces antibodies in response. After the threat has passed, many of the antibodies will break down, but immune cells called memory cells remain in the body.” Vaccines also work on a community level. Some people can't be vaccinated, either because they are too young, or because their immune systems are too weak, according to the CDC. But if everyone around them is vaccinated, unvaccinated people are protected by something called herd immunity. In other words, they're unlikely to even come in contact with the disease, so they probably won't get sick. When it comes to vaccines, sometimes it can pay to follow the crowd.

         <h1>Why Vaccinate? </h1>
         <hr>
		   <h2 style="margin: 5% 0 0 11%;">1. Vaccination saves lives.</h2> 
           <p style="width:70%;margin:auto;"> 
			The primary benefit of vaccination is that it prevents disease. Immunization is considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the 20th century, and experts agree that immunization is key to staying healthy. In one year, vaccines prevent more than 8,500 child hospitalizations in Colorado, 33,000 deaths in the U.S., and between 2 and 3 million deaths worldwide.
			<h2 style="width:70%;margin: 5% 0 0 11%;">2. Vaccination protects the people you care about.</h2> <p style="width:70%;margin:auto;">Vaccination is not just a personal choice. The vaccinated community helps to protect those who are not vaccinated, a concept known as “herd immunity” or “community immunity.” Simply put, when a person is vaccinated, they prevent disease from being spread to others in the community, including:	Babies too young to receive vaccines
			Unvaccinated children and adults	Pregnant women	The elderly	Individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with asthma, chronic illness, or undergoing treatment for cancer	Individuals who are allergic to vaccine components</p>
		   	<h2 style="margin: 5% 0 0 11%;">3. Vaccines are cost effective.</h2> <p style="width:70%;margin:auto;">Not only do vaccines save lives, they save money too. It is always cheaper to prevent a disease than to treat it. The routine childhood immunization program in one birth cohort saves $13.6 billion in direct costs. Every dollar spent on childhood immunizations saves $18.40. In Colorado, the cost of treating 538 children hospitalized for vaccine-preventable diseases in one year totaled $29.2 million.</p>
		   <h2 style="margin: 5% 0 0 11%;">4. Vaccines are safe.</h2> <p style="width:70%;margin:auto;">Vaccines undergo rigorous safety testing prior to being approved by the Food and Drug Administraton (FDA) and are continually monitored for safety. Vaccines are also studied to be administered together to protect children. </p>
